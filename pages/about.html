<h3>About</h3>

<p>
  This site is dedicated to the memory of Zac Rodgers, who left us too soon.
</p>
<h4>Who is King Spook?</h4>
<img id="ks-thumb" src="/assets/img/art/kingspook-color.jpg" />
<p>
  King Spook is a character that frequently appeared in the artwork of Zac
  Rodgers during the mid to late '90's. Not much is known about what King Spook
  is meant to represent. He is part of a reccuring theme of death, the undead
  and other monsters that appears throughout Zac's work. I think King Spook can
  signify many things. Since he has no firm definition, we can allow him to be
  whatever we need him to be in the moment, a fool, a savior, a warning of woe,
  an icon of the grandeur of lost youth.

<h4>Who is Zac Rodgers?</h4>
<img class="img-fluid" id="zac-pic" src="/assets/img/ZacPic0.png" />
<p>
  Zac was a wonderful human being. An artist, musician and writer. A great
  conversationalist. A caring friend. A thinker of deep thoughts and wild
  inspirations and meaningless mumbles. A complicated and facinating character
  that, if you've never met him, you would have been delighted to.
</p>
<p>
  He had a way of speaking without judgment that allowed him to speak with
  anyone. People would open up to him, on the street, at a party, on the bus or
  at the local corner store. He made instant friends because he actually
  listened to people. He didn't shy away from strangers and he would certainly
  dive right in if he saw a girl that caught his eye. He didn't make you feel
  stupid even though he was brilliant. Rather, he made you feel connected and
  heard and welcome.
</p>
<p>
  Zac was constantly creating. He had a manic energy spinning out little doodles
  and drawings on napkins and cups or his pants or a wall; whatever was at hand.
  He could spin out songs and poems in the same fashion, he was an
  ever-overflowing cup of ideas and dream things. Much of his art was
  impermanent and is lost to time. Much was given away as gifts and might hang
  on a wall or sit snug in a box of memories. Maybe you have one. His art was
  made with a spirit of freedom and as such lives on without him or is lost on
  its own adventure and that's ok. We have only a small sampling here and that
  too, is ok.

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>
  Music was a big part of the life of Zac and, we assume, king spook. Zac came
  to music a little late but, once he found it, he was all in. His first go at
  being a musician was to put together a drum set of pots, pans, tins and
  buckets which he would play on the streets of Denver for spare change. He
  eventaully pieced together a real drum set but played it only briefly before
  moving on to the bass guitar. He played in the Denver Bands
  <em>The Clouds</em>,
  <em>The Space Kitchen</em>
  and
  <em>Auxilliary.</em>
  He played a bright orange, pawn shop bass through a silver, sparkley, pawn
  shop, Kustom amplifier for many years before upgrading instrument and amp in
  the last year of his life. He had a Tascam 4-track recorder in the late 90's
  which he used to make many recordings loosely grouped together under the name
  <em>Space Case.</em>
